    "content": "\n# Introduction to Islam\n\nIslam is one of the world's major monotheistic religions, founded in the 7th century CE by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in the Arabian Peninsula. The word \"Islam\" means \"submission\" or \"surrender\" to the will of Allah (God).\n\n## Core Beliefs\n\n**Tawhid (Unity of God)**: The fundamental belief in the oneness and uniqueness of Allah. Muslims believe that Allah is the same God worshipped by Jews and Christians, but that Islam represents the final and complete revelation.\n\n*\"Say: He is Allah, the One! Allah, the Eternal, Absolute; He begets not, nor is He begotten; And there is none like unto Him.\"* (Quran 112:1-4)\n\n## The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)\n\nBorn in Mecca around 570 CE, Muhammad received his first revelation from the angel Gabriel (Jibril) at age 40. Over 23 years, he received the complete Quran and established the foundations of Islamic civilization.\n\n## Historical Context\n\nIslam emerged in 7th-century Arabia, a time of tribal conflicts and social inequality. The message of Islam brought unity, social justice, and a comprehensive way of life that transformed Arabian society and eventually spread across continents.\n\n## Modern Relevance\n\nToday, Islam is practiced by over 1.8 billion people worldwide, making it the second-largest religion. Its teachings on social justice, community welfare, and spiritual development remain highly relevant in addressing contemporary challenges.\n\n## Reflection Questions\n- How does the concept of Tawhid influence a Muslim's worldview?\n- What historical factors contributed to the rapid spread of Islam?\n- How do Islamic principles apply to modern life?\n                ",
