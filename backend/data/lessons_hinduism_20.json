    "content": "\n# Introduction to Hinduism\n\nHinduism is one of the world's oldest religious traditions, with roots stretching back over 4,000 years. Unlike many religions, Hinduism has no single founder, central authority, or universally accepted doctrine, making it remarkably diverse.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n**Dharma**: Righteous living according to one's duty and cosmic order\n**Karma**: The law of cause and effect governing moral actions\n**Samsara**: The cycle of birth, death, and rebirth\n**Moksha**: Liberation from the cycle of reincarnation\n\n*\"Whenever dharma declines and the purpose of life is forgotten, I manifest myself on earth.\"* (Bhagavad Gita 4.7)\n\n## Sacred Texts\n\nThe Vedas are the oldest scriptures, containing hymns, rituals, and philosophical discussions. The Upanishads explore spiritual philosophy, while epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata (which includes the Bhagavad Gita) provide moral and spiritual guidance.\n\n## Diversity and Unity\n\nHinduism encompasses numerous traditions, deities, practices, and philosophies. This diversity is seen as strength, reflecting the belief that there are many paths to the divine truth.\n\n## Modern Hinduism\n\nToday, Hinduism is practiced by over one billion people, primarily in India and Nepal, with growing communities worldwide. Its emphasis on tolerance, spiritual seeking, and environmental harmony resonates with many contemporary concerns.\n\n## Reflection Questions\n- How does the concept of dharma guide Hindu life?\n- What role does diversity play in Hindu tradition?\n- How do ancient Hindu teachings address modern challenges?\n                ",
