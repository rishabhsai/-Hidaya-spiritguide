# Feature Document: Duoreligon

## 1. Executive Summary

**Vision:** To become the leading mobile platform for religious education and spiritual growth, making the study of faith accessible, personalized, and practical for a global audience. Duoreligon will be an inclusive and unbiased tool that empowers users to explore the world's religions and deepen their connection to their own faith through engaging, AI-driven learning experiences.

**Problem:** In an increasingly secular and fast-paced world, many people lack a clear, structured, and unbiased way to learn about different religions. This leads to misunderstanding and missed opportunities for personal growth. For those already practicing a faith, it can be challenging to connect ancient teachings to modern-day problems and maintain consistent spiritual practice. Existing resources are often dense, dogmatic, or fail to provide a practical, personalized path for growth.

**Target Audience:**
*   **The Curious:** Individuals with a desire to understand different worldviews, cultural histories, and belief systems in an academic, neutral, and digestible format.
*   **The Practitioner:** Individuals who identify with a specific faith and are seeking a modern, engaging tool to deepen their knowledge, improve their daily practice, and find relevant guidance for their personal challenges.

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1. AI-Powered Personalization Engine
This is the core of the application, designed to create a unique and adaptive journey for each user.

*   **Conversational Onboarding:**
    *   Upon first launch, the user engages in a friendly, chatbot-style conversation.
    *   The AI asks questions to determine the user's persona (Curious, Practitioner, etc.), goals (e.g., "learn about Buddhism," "manage anxiety through my faith"), current knowledge level, and preferred learning style (e.g., stories, direct teachings, practical tasks).
    *   For Practitioners, it will ask about specific challenges they face (e.g., "patience with family," "finding motivation at work").

*   **Dynamic Learning Path Generation:**
    *   Based on the onboarding, the AI constructs a personalized curriculum.
    *   **For "The Curious":** The path will be a logical progression through a religion's history, key figures, core tenets, and cultural impact.
    *   **For "The Practitioner":** The path will be a thematic journey. If a user struggles with "patience," the AI will curate a series of lessons, stories, and verses from their chosen sacred text that directly address patience.

### 3.2. Content & Learning Experience
The daily interaction will be built around engaging, easily digestible content.

*   **Bite-Sized Lessons:**
    *   Each lesson is designed to be completed in 5-10 minutes.
    *   Content includes key concepts, historical context, interpretations of texts, and stories.
    *   Gamification elements (streaks, points, badges) will be used to encourage daily engagement and consistency.

*   **Sacred Text Integration:**
    *   A searchable, full-text library of major religious scriptures (Bible, Quran, Torah, Vedas, etc.) with modern translations.
    *   The AI can pull specific verses or passages relevant to a lesson or a user's stated problem.
    *   Users can tap on a verse to get context, different interpretations, and see how it connects to other teachings.

*   **Practical Application Tasks:**
    *   To bridge the gap between knowledge and practice, the app will issue daily or weekly tasks.
    *   Examples:
        *   *For Spiritual Sam:* "Today, when you feel stressed at work, pause and reflect on this verse from Philippians. Set a reminder to do this."
        *   *For Devout Diana:* "This week, practice the principle of 'Sabr' (patience) by consciously taking a deep breath before responding in a frustrating situation with your children."
    *   A simple journaling feature will allow users to reflect on how the task went.

### 3.3. Standard & Community Features

*   **Pre-built Curriculums:**
    *   In addition to AI paths, users can select from a library of standard, expertly-designed courses like "Introduction to Christianity," "The Five Pillars of Islam," or "The Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism."

*   **Progress Tracking & Visualization:**
    *   A personal dashboard that visualizes the user's journey, completed lessons, streaks, and key insights they've saved.
    *   For Practitioners, it can track moods or feelings associated with journal entries to show progress over time.

*   **(Phase 2) Community & Discussion:**
    *   Moderated discussion forums for each course or topic.
    *   Users can share insights, ask questions, and discuss how they apply teachings in their lives, creating a supportive community.
